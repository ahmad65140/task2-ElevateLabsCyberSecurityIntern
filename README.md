# task2-ElevateLabsCyberSecurityIntern

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing phishing emails to identify common indicators of malicious intent and to demonstrate effective detection methods. By following a structured set of investigative steps, the exercise highlights both technical and behavioral signs of phishing, as well as preventive measures to reduce risk.

## Tasks Completed:

1. **Obtained Sample Phishing Emails**
   * Collected publicly available phishing email samples for analysis.

2. **Examined Sender’s Email Address**
   * Checked for spoofing attempts, where attackers used domains resembling legitimate organizations but with slight alterations.

3. **Reviewed Email Headers**
   * Used an online email header analyzer to detect discrepancies, such as originating servers unrelated to the claimed sender.

4. **Identified Suspicious Links/Attachments**
   * Detected embedded links leading to fraudulent websites and noted potentially harmful attachments.

5. **Analyzed Email Language**
   * Observed urgent and threatening phrases designed to pressure recipients into taking immediate action.

6. **Checked for Mismatched URLs**
   * Verified that displayed URLs did not match their actual destinations by hovering over links.

7. **Noted Spelling/Grammar Errors**
   * Found grammatical inconsistencies and spelling mistakes, which further reduced the credibility of the emails.

8. **Summarized Phishing Traits**
   * Documented the key characteristics of phishing emails: spoofed senders, anomalous headers, malicious links or files, urgency, mismatched URLs, and poor language quality.

## Key Findings
Phishing emails often rely on social engineering techniques—urgency, threats, and deception—to trick users into compromising sensitive information. Technical artifacts such as spoofed addresses, header anomalies, and malicious URLs reinforce their illegitimacy.

## Precautions and Countermeasures:

- Verify sender addresses and email headers.
- Hover over links before clicking.
- Avoid opening suspicious attachments.
- Be cautious of urgent or threatening language.
- Report suspicious emails to IT/security teams.
- Use technical defenses: spam filters, multi-factor authentication, and up-to-date security patches.
